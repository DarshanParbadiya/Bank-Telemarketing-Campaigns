## **Overview**

This project automates key steps in machine learning workflows:
- Train models with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Save model results, predictions, and confusion matrices as checkpoints.
- Resume training from checkpoints when interrupted.
- Visualize model performance using ROC Curves, Precision-Recall Curves, and Confusion Matrices.

The project is built for binary classification problems, particularly those requiring probabilistic outputs for model evaluation.

## **Features**

1. **Checkpoint Management**  
   Save and load checkpoints, including trained models, evaluation metrics, and predictions.

2. **Model Training**  
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.  
   - Compute evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.  
   - Save results and model probabilities for further analysis.

3. **Result Visualization**  
   - **ROC Curve**: Assess True Positive and False Positive tradeoffs.  
   - **Precision-Recall Curve**: Evaluate precision vs. recall.  
   - **Confusion Matrices**: Visualize misclassifications.

4. **Cross-Validation**  
   Automatically calculates cross-validation scores and averages.

5. **Modularity**  
   Designed to easily add new models or extend functionality.
